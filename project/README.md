# Project
##### Tracey Kong and Angela Lim
* **Choice 1:** A web app that searches key terms from a data set with the ability to do AND, NOT, and OR queries. With the stemming library, we will be able to produce more relevent results. The result also provides additional information such as how many times the term appears.

###### Note:
Final project will be on Tracey's repo
